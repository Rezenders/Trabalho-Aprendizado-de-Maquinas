course philosophy
the goal of a graduate education is not so much the actual content that you learn but rather that you learn how to learn new things on your own this course will consist of much less lecture time than most courses instead reading and problems will be assigned before each class period class members should have already read and understood the material before class students will be asked in class to present short portions of the material class participation will be graded as discussed below formation of study groups to prepare for class is recommended
grading

	exams 
		
		 tests  each
		final exam 
		
	programs 
	class participation 
		
		students will be regularly asked to present or discuss reading 
			materials in class grading will be on whether or not you
			have prepared and thought carefully about the material grading
			is based on prepared or unprepared not right or wrong 
			missunderstandings of the material can be corrected by class
			discussions and will not be counted against you
